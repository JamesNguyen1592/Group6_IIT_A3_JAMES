                The team’s name through consensus among members is “FinancialGen”. 
                This is going to be the team’s official name throughout the assignment 3 progress. 
                The purpose for selecting the name is due to our goal of developing software solutions for the Finance’s sector; 
                while the name: 
                “Gen” represents the demographics on the receiving-end like middle-age, seniors, and more. 
                Thus, the team hopes to develop, solve, and handle any emerging challenges for both the community and the market.

                I’m currently majoring in IT at RMIT, and have six years of study abroad in Australia. For hobbies, I love to integrate video graphics cards (VGAs) into a motherboard as well as watch videos about building gaming PCs. 
                Additionally, I found my interest in several coding videos where coders show both logical thinking and technical skills to solve issues. Finally, I draw a lesson that no matter how much time it takes to complete, 
                as long as you stick with your plan, you will find tremendous approaches for yourself to select which is the most efficient and will let you see it bear fruit. My IT interest is through acquainting with certain IT sections like writing Python and C#. 
                Furthermore, I studied fundamental concepts in computing science, including database concepts and data’s queries using SQL language, principles of good GUI design, and computer components. In addition, I currently gained knowledge of Linux commands, HTML and CSS. 
                In the past, I’ve built some webpages and engaged in modifying hardwares during high school in Australia.

                I’m a novice in IT and a freshman at RMIT. 
                I have certain knowledge in using Python, Github, Linux or some web functions like HTML. 
                During leisure hours, I’d watch the news or play video games. 
                These help me to relax and connect with friends. 
                Also documents technology and programming so I can use it for research and improve my IT knowledge. 
                For my IT interest, I love to spend time learning and researching about Python, Github, HTML and some other technologies. 
                From my perspective, Python and Github are not really difficult. 
                However, my remember ability is not really good, within python for example have many structure and formula have to remember so that is my huge hurdle and I’m trying to improve. 
                Beside that, my high school teacher taught and helped me experience some kind of technologies like AR, firework. 
                I just joined the IT world in a short time because I don’t have much experience with technology. 
                Some experience I got like making some programmes on Python and how to use many tools of Microsoft and Alphabet. 
                Beside that, some complicated technology like AR, VR or cryptography that I had a period to experience when I was in grade 11. 
                For my IT experience, I’ve developed certain video games mods for users to download and play with. 
                Not only that, I’ve engaged in collaboration with peers in building a web page for a computer’s store.
